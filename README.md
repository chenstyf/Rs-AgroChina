Codes for calculating the seasonal variations of soil respiration in agroecosystems in China.
Soil respiration data set in agroecosystems in China

Last data update: 8 March 2023

About Rs-AgroChina
---------------------------------
The project includes codes and data set. We developed a biophysical model to simulate the seasonal variations of soil respiration in agroecosystems in China.
The soil respiration data set includes the periodically measured soil respiration, soil temperature, moisture, leaf area index (LAI), and soil properties
at twenty-six agroecosystem sites in China. These data were from the measurement site Nanjing for model parameterization and calibration and the
published literatures from the Science Citation Index (SCI) database.
